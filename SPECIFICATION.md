## Overview

This web application allows users to drag and drop a single image into the browser, upscale it by a fixed factor (2x), and download the upscaled result. The app is designed for simplicity, speed, and privacy, with a minimal interface and no user registration.

---

## **Core Features**

- Drag-and-drop image upload (single image only)
- Optional file picker for accessibility
- Image preview before upscaling
- Fixed upscaling factor (2x only)
- "Upscale" button to trigger processing
- Download button for the upscaled image
- Support for common image formats (JPG, PNG, WEBP, etc.)
- Basic error handling and user feedback

---

## **User Flow**

1. User lands on the homepage.
2. User drags and drops a single image file onto the upload area (or uses a file picker).
3. The app previews the uploaded image.
4. User clicks the "Upscale" button (fixed 2x factor).
5. The app processes the image and displays the upscaled result.
6. User clicks "Download" to save the upscaled image.

## **Frontend Specification**

### **UI Components**

- **Header:** App name and brief instructions.
- **Drop Area:** Large, visually distinct area for drag-and-drop; clicking opens file picker.
- **Preview Container:** Shows thumbnail of uploaded image.
- **Upscale Controls:**
  - No upscaling factor selection; always 2x.
  - "Upscale" button.
- **Result Display:**
  - Shows upscaled image preview.
  - "Download" button.
- **Feedback/Errors:** Area for status messages (e.g., "Processing...", "Unsupported file type", "File too large", "Error upscaling image").

### **Accessibility**

- All actions available via keyboard and mouse.
- ARIA labels for drop area and buttons.
- High-contrast, responsive design for mobile and desktop.

---

## **Backend Specification**

### **API Endpoints**

- `POST /api/upscale`
  - **Input:** Single image file (multipart/form-data)
  - **Output:** Upscaled image (binary stream or downloadable link)
  - **Validation:** Check file type, enforce maximum file size (10MB), and ensure only one file is uploaded.

### **Processing Logic**

- Accept single image and parameter.
- Use a pre-trained AI upscaling model (e.g., ESRGAN, Real-ESRGAN, or similar) or a high-quality interpolation method for 2x upscaling.
- Return upscaled image in the same format as input.

---

## **Technical Stack**

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Vanilla or lightweight framework)
- **Backend:** Python (Flask or FastAPI)
- **Image Processing:** Python image libraries (Pillow for interpolation, or integrate with AI upscaling model)
- **Storage:** No persistent storage required; process images in-memory.
- **Deployment:** Single server or serverless function (for stateless processing)
- **Database:** None (stateless)

---

## **Supported Image Formats**

- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- PNG (.png)
- WEBP (.webp)
- TIFF (.tif, .tiff)
- BMP (.bmp)

---

## **Non-Functional Requirements**

- **Performance:** Upscaling should complete in under 10 seconds for standard images (10MB): Show error and reject upload.
- Multiple files: Show error and reject upload.
- Processing failure: Show error and allow retry.

## **Example UI Layout**

```
+--------------------------------------+
|        Simple Image Upscaler         |
|  Drag & drop your image here         |
|  or click to select a file           |
+--------------------------------------+
| [Image Preview]                      |
| Upscale Factor: 2x (fixed)           |
| [Upscale Button]                     |
+--------------------------------------+
| [Upscaled Image Preview]             |
| [Download Button]                    |
+--------------------------------------+
| [Status/Error Message]               |
+--------------------------------------+
```

## **References & Inspiration**

- Drag-and-drop UI and file picker
- Fixed 2x upscaling for simplicity and performance
- 10MB maximum file size as best practice

---

## **Potential Enhancements (Not in MVP)**

- Batch upscaling (multiple images at once)
- Additional upscaling modes (e.g., Anime, Old Photo)
- Advanced settings (denoise, sharpen)
- History of processed images (if privacy policy allows)
- User authentication for higher limits
